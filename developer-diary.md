# GameStudy Developer Diary

---
This developer diary records the planning, design, development, and testing phases of the GameStudy application. Entries are made regularly to track progress, challenges, and decisions throughout the software development lifecycle.

## Developer Diary Entry #1

**Title:** Final Project Idea  
**Date:** 14/04/25

Today I finalized my idea for the project, a study app called GameStudy. The concept is to create a game-like experience where users progress in a simple game by logging study hours. The goal is to motivate students to study more by turning studying into something fun, competitive, and rewarding.

This project was inspired by the growing issue of students struggling with distractions, lack of motivation, and short attention spans, often due to social media. GameStudy aims to flip that by giving students a reason to stay focused and productive, using game mechanics to replace unproductive screen time. The app will be built as a progressive web app (PWA) so it works on both desktop and mobile. The focus will be the study timer and game integration, keeping things lightweight and engaging.

**Title:** SRS Creation and Progression  
**Date:** 16/04/25

Today I completed the first draft of the SRS for GameStudy. I outlined the app’s purpose, its core features (like the study timer, XP system, and achievements), and defined the main user base, being the students needing motivation to study. I simplified the non-functional requirements to keep them broad, while ensuring security was clearly covered, including bcrypt hashing and input sanitization. I chose not to include a separate “User Needs” section, as it’s already covered through other parts of the document. Overall, the SRS now provides a clear outline for development moving forward.

**Title:** Implementation Method Chosen and Financial Feasibility Study created  
**Date:** 19/04/25

Today I worked on finalizing and justifying the implementation method for the GameStudy project. Out of the 4 available implementation methods, phased implementation was chosen as the best fit for the app's needs. This method will allow us to roll out features in sprints, starting with core functionality like the study timer and user profiles, and more complex elements like player leaderboards and other features later. The phased approach minimizes risk and will also allow for continuous feedback during development. I have also begun working on the Financial Feasibility Study. This included outlining as specifically as possible the planned application, target markets, and unique characteristics of the application, as well as preparing a projected costs statement.

**Title:** Financial Feasibility Study completed  
**Date:** 21/04/25

Today I completed the financial feasibility report on the GameStudy project. This included filling out the projected costs statement, estimating first-year development and operating costs, and outlining projected revenue based on market research. I defined the value proposition of the application as motivating students to stay engaged by monitoring study using gamification and identified a clearly established gap / niche in the market for this type of product. I had also analyzed competitor's services, assessed their pros and cons, and strategically placed GameStudy. An Opening Day Balance Sheet was created that listed all assets required and potential liabilities. Finally, I checked all the information to ensure the projections are realistic and within the project's scope. From this, the project was determined to be financially viable, and the analysis justifies the decision.

**Title:** SWOT Analysis, Storyboard Created and Completed, Pitch Design  
**Date:** 23/04/25

Project Pitch

Today I completed the SWOT analysis for the phased implementation method chosen for GameStudy. I broke down the internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as the external opportunities and threats, and organized them into detailed paragraph form. This analysis will help communicate why phased implementation is the most suitable strategy for the app and what factors we should be prepared for as development progresses. I also began developing visual content for the project pitch, particularly focusing on the storyboard. I created a four-panel storyboard that outlines the basic user interface in GameStudy, from logging in to tracking study time and earning achievements. The storyboard gives a simple preview of what the user interface will look like. I then worked on structuring the project's pitch. I began organizing the content, including the SRSD key points, implementation justification, financial feasibility summary, and now the SWOT analysis and storyboard into a clear and professional format.

## Developer Diary Entry #6

**Title:** Begun Research & Planning, Social and Ethical Issues  
**Date:** 27/04/25

Today I committed to establishing GameStudy's underlying social and ethical basis, starting with accessibility requirements like screen reader support and low-bandwidth capability to make it accessible to everyone of all socioeconomic classes, and sustainable development standards like power-saving programming and server hosting to reduce our impact on the planet. On the ethical side, I investigated other interaction models, giving up on addictive features like Duolingo streaks and instead committing to healthier Forest-style balanced usage reminders, and authored key privacy policies from Quizlet's open data principle, though this revealed we'll need additional development time for full accessibility integration and should plan more towards green hosting solutions. I also understood that we need cultural consultation in designing avatars and themes so that we do not engage in stereotypes and combining all these learnings into a brief that we are going to utilize tomorrow during our prototyping period and ensuring we address all these social and ethical issues ahead of time.

## Developer Diary Entry #7

**Title:** Compliance and Legislative Issues addressed  
**Date:** 1/05/25

I conducted research on legal and compliance issues that the GameStudy project needs to meet as well as how to mitigate them. The app, as it would be monitoring personal study routines and account information, must comply with the Australian Privacy Act (1988) and NSW Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act (1998), which respectively ensure that personal information are gathered, stored, and handled securely. I also considered copyright compliance, especially regarding any icons, sounds, or visual assets used in the app. To avoid infringement, I’ll ensure all media is either original, royalty-free, or licensed for use. This research will guide my decisions around data handling and content throughout development.

## Developer Diary Entry #8

**Title:** Created Diagrams of System  
**Date:** 5/05/25

Today I created Level 0 and Level 1 Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) for the GameStudy project. These diagrams provide an overview of how data moves through the system, including interactions between external users and internal processes. The Level 0 DFD describes the system's main inputs and outputs, whereas the Level 1 DFD digs deeper into internal functions like data handling, authentication, and study tracking.

## Developer Diary Entry #9

**Title:** Structure Chart and Data Dictionary  
**Date:** 8/05/25

Today I developed a Structure Chart and Data Dictionary for the GameStudy project. The Structure Chart shows how the system modules are arranged and interact with one another. This clarifies the flow of control and the breakdown of the operation. The Data Dictionary outlines the key data items utilized in the system, including their types, forms, and goals.

**Title:** Gantt Chart and Class Diagrams  
**Date:** 13/05/25

Today I created a Gantt chart for my project which allows me to view and schedule my sprints in order to finish the task on time. I have also created UML class diagrams which show the different methods and properties of each class.

## Developer Diary Entry #11

**Title:** UAT Document  
**Date:** 16/05/25

Today I started writing the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) documentation for GameStudy.  This included creating test scenarios centred on important elements such as the study timer, achievements, and user authentication. This document's purpose is to guarantee that the software project meets the functional requirements of the client prior to the final release.

**Title:** Quality Assurance Criteria and Software Development Approach  
**Date:** 23/05/25

Today I completed quality assurance requirements for GameStudy, including metrics for usability, dependability, and security. I also documented the chosen software development approach, being the agile approach, confirming the phased sprints model which emphasises integration and testing through consistent feedback.
