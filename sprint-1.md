# **Sprint 1: Authentication & Setup**

## **Backlog Tasks**

- [X] Set up project environment and repository structure.
- [X] Configure development tools and dependencies (e.g., Python packages, linters).
- [X] Implement user signup form with:
  - Username/Email field.
  - Password field.
  - Signup button.
- [X] Design a responsive and mobile-friendly signup and login pages.
- [X] Create backend routes for:
  - `/signup`: receive and validate user registration data.
  - `/login`: authenticate users securely.
  - `/logout`: clear user session.
- [X] Securely store passwords using hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
- [X] Manage user sessions securely with:
  - Session creation on login.
  - Session expiration for security.
- [x] Implement error handling and display user-friendly messages for failed login/signup.
- [X] Write basic tests for authentication routes and functionality.
- [X] Integrate security best practices at every step (e.g., input validation, CSRF protection).
